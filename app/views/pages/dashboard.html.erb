               By looking at a visual representation of all the areas of your life at once, the wheel helps you to better understand which of your life areas are flourishing and which ones need the most work.</p>

              <p>The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study.
               The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals. Get a to-do list and a timer. Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings. When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed. Then enjoy a five-minute break. After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.</p>
